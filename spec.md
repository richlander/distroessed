# Markdown Table Generation with Dynamic Column Widths

## Overview
This specification outlines the requirements for implementing dynamic column width calculation in the markdown table generation library. The goal is to optimize table layout by analyzing the complete table content rather than using static, hardcoded column widths.

## Requirements

### 1. Dynamic Width Calculation
- Column widths should be calculated based on the actual content of the entire table
- The algorithm should consider all rows (including headers) before determining optimal widths
- No hardcoded or static column width values should be used

### 2. Global Content Analysis
- The algorithm must have a "global view" of all table content
- Width calculations should be deferred until all rows are added
- The optimization should consider the distribution of content lengths across all rows

### 3. Algorithm Characteristics
- Should handle outliers gracefully (very long content in a few cells shouldn't dominate the layout)
- Should ensure reasonable minimum widths for readability
- Should balance between optimal space usage and readability
- Should work with tables of varying sizes and content distributions

### 4. Configurable Parameters
- The algorithm should have configurable parameters for fine-tuning
- Parameters should include:
  - Percentile threshold for width calculation
  - Tolerance multiplier for handling outliers
  - Minimum width constraints

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Width calculation should be efficient for large tables
- Memory usage should be reasonable when collecting content statistics

## Current Implementation Analysis

The existing `Table.cs` implementation already includes:
- Dynamic width calculation using percentile-based algorithm
- Global content analysis (collects all row data before rendering)
- Configurable parameters (`PercentileThreshold`, `ToleranceMultiplier`)
- Three-factor width calculation: header length, percentile content length, max within tolerance

## Areas for Potential Improvement

1. **Algorithm Refinement**: The current percentile-based approach could be enhanced
2. **Parameter Optimization**: Default values might need tuning
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Improved handling of extreme content distributions
4. **Documentation**: Better documentation of the algorithm and its parameters
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests to validate the algorithm behavior

## Success Criteria

- Tables render with optimal column widths based on content
- No hardcoded width values remain in the implementation
- Algorithm performs well across different content patterns
- Configuration parameters allow fine-tuning for different use cases
- Comprehensive test coverage validates the implementation
